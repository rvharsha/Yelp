Codepath Assignment 1 - Yelp
========

Note: I could focus on learning the concepts. I had to redo the app after the Demo class and I got the all functionality working. 

I will be adding more data.


1. How many hours did it take to complete? 
~ 15 hours

2. Which required and optional stories have you completed?
Search results page
1. Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
2. Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
3. Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
The filters you should actually have are: deals (on/off).
Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
